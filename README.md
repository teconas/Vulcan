An opinionated C# Extension Library for Common Tools, Utilies and Extension Methods.

## Purpose
- I ended up reimplementing the same helper and utitilies over and over
- So I collected the ones I really need all the time
- Minimal by necessity:
  - Nothing in here is there "just-in-case".
  - Just the oney I actally need all the time.

## Whats in it?
- Extension Methods for Fluency (Method-Chaining)
- Extensions Method commonly missing
- Some Helper
- Some Data Structures

## What is it for?
- It is meant to be general purpose, not software, framework or case specific.
- It should Work with ASP.NET, Unity and other C# Usage.

## Opionated?
- I prefer functional Patterns
- I prefer Immutability
- I really prefer "left to right" statement flow like Method-Chaining & Pipeline-Pattern
